# Honors Topics Git

This is someone elses project that I worked on. It has the base functionality of git hub. There is no documentation for it beacuse this is more of joke project. 
To use this interface through the git class and use references to files within the scope of where the code is running. Most code should work for absolutes paths but it is not something that is being tested for.
